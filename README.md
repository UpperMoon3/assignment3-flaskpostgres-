ASSIGNMENT 3:

This is assignment number 3 for python classes by Shayakhmetov Madi from CS-2101.
This task includes the usage of "Flask" and "PostgreSQL" to create a page that can give information about NFT and saves that information inside of database.

LAUNCH:

You are downloading the sql file and launching python code in your compiler with pre-downloaded flask on your machine. After that you copy the url adress, something like "http://127.0.0.1:5000/form-example" and pasting it in your web-browser. 

USAGE:

To use this application, you just copy the address of any nft and paste it inside of bar. After that, press the 'get info' button and you will have information about needed nft.

POSSIBLE PROBLEMS:

To be completly honest, I got some problems with connecting the database. I kinda connected it, but I am not sure if it works properly. So, I am really sorry if it is not working :(
